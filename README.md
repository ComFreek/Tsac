# Tsac

## Purpose

Tsac delivers a litte GUI for adding TypeScript ability to Windows 8 HTML/JS apps.

## How to use

### Preparation (do this once)
1. Setup PowerShell Execution Policy
 
    1. Start PowerShell with administrator privileges. You can use Windows File Explorer: *File (menu) --> Open Windows PowerShell --> [...] as an administrator*.

    2. Type and run this command: `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`.

2. Download/Update Tsac

    1. Download Tsac either via Git or as [ZIP](https://github.com/ComFreek/Tsac/archive/master.zip).
    
    2. Execute *install.ps1* (via context menu). It's recommended that you start it via an already opened PowerShell console with administrator privileges!
       <br /><br />
       The script will download the TypeScript Git repository and extract the declration files *winjs.d.ts* and *winrt.d.ts* into the official TypeScript VS extension folder.

### Convert project

1. **BACKUP** the complete folder of your app!

2. Run *gui.ps1* via the context menu (*right-click --> Run with PowerShell*).
   <br />
   (Tip: create a shortcut for quick access!)

   **HINTS:**
   1. Don't select your solution file (`*`.sln), select your ***.jsproj** file!
      <br />
      If you want to reselect a JS file or if you want to convert another project, **restart** the application. It's a known bug that it can't handle such a situation!

   2. Be sure to activate the ***Is this the first time [...]* checkbox** if you're initially converting the project.
